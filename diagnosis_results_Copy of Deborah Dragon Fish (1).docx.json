        "Left Ear Overall Result": "Mixed",
        "Left Ear Degree": "Moderate",
        "Right Ear Overall Result": "No hearing loss",
        "Right Ear Degree": "1",
        "Reasoning": "The left ear shows abnormal middle ear function with flat tympanometry and limited cochlear response in the moderate range (60 dB eHL for click and 50 dB eHL for 1000 Hz with +10 dB correction), indicating a mixed hearing loss (both conductive and sensorineural components). The right ear shows essentially normal middle ear function and a cochlear response at 20 dB eHL, indicating no hearing loss. Therefore, the right ear is the 'Better Ear' with no hearing loss, and the left ear has a moderate mixed hearing loss. [Guideline 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10]"
