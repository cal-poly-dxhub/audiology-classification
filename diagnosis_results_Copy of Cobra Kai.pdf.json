            "Reasoning": "The child demonstrated normal to near-normal hearing acuity based on behavioral responses to live voice and narrow band/warble tone stimuli. (Guideline: If hearing is normal, the type is 'No hearing loss', and the degree is '1'. However, since 'Normal hearing' is specified within the range of -10 to 15 dB, no degree is required.)"

            "Reasoning": "Otoscopy showed cerumen, but tympanometry and acoustic reflex were normal. DPOAE showed normal emissions across 1000-4000 Hz and reduced but present emissions at 6000-8000 Hz, indicating normal hearing within the tested parameters. (Guideline: If hearing is normal, the type is 'No hearing loss', and the degree is '1'. However, since 'Normal hearing' is specified within the range of -10 to 15 dB, no degree is required.)"

            "Reasoning": "Despite the stenotic ear canal and cerumen presence, tympanometry showed normal middle ear pressure and compliance. Acoustic reflex and DPOAE were within normal limits across the tested frequencies, indicating normal hearing. (Guideline: If hearing is normal, the type is 'No hearing loss', and the degree is '1'. However, since 'Normal hearing' is specified within the range of -10 to 15 dB, no degree is required.)"
