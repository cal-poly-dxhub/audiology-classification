He also has a skin tag on the left pinna. Patient's parents deny concerns for a family history of pediatric hearing loss.

She did not pass her newborn hearing screening in the right ear and CMV screening was negative. Previous ABR results have indicated moderate hearing loss in the right ear and mild rising to normal hearing in the left ear. She is enrolled in Early Intervention services. \n\nMEASUREMENTS: Patient was tested in natural sleep. The patient was seen ***** for the 7:30 ABR slot, but did not sleep. Tympanometry and DPOAEs were completed at that time and indicated normal middle ear status for the right ear and an immobile middle ear system in the left ear. DPOAEs were absent from 2000-8000 Hz in both ears. This provider saw the patient at the 10:30 ABR slot and completed with ABR testing once the patient fell asleep. See the database note for more information. Unmasked bone conduction at 1000 Hz indicates no poorer than a mild hearing loss in one ear, however the patient awoke before testing could be completed.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Results indicate a moderate hearing loss in the right ear and a moderate rising to mild sloping to moderate hearing loss in the left ear. Unmasked bone conduction at 4000 Hz indicates a mild hearing loss in one ear. This degree of hearing loss will interfere with speech and spoken language development. The patient will benefit from use of amplification for at least the right ear. Further testing should be completed to confirm results for the left ear as this is a change from previous results. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n- Consider a sedated ABR to confirm thresholds obtained ***** due to change in responses in the left ear\n- Schedule a follow-up with pediatric otolaryngology\n- Schedule a Communication Needs Assessment at the Salem office\n\n**Here are the audiometric test

Her mother has a history of ear infections, cholesteatoma, and multiple middle ear surgeries as a child. Mother reports that she has no hearing in her left ear and uses a right hearing aid. There are no new concerns for Aliannys' hearing. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were present at 2000-8000 Hz in the right ear. DPOAEs could not be completed on the left ear due to high patient noise. Tympanometry was completed with a 1000 Hz probe tone. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Results are consistent with normal hearing sensitivity bilaterally. Tympanometry suggests mobile middle ear systems bilaterally. Presence of DPOAEs is consistent with good cochlear outer hair cell function and suggests normal to near-normal hearing. Hearing is currently adequate for speech and language development. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: Follow-up with pediatrician if new concerns for ear infections or hearing arise.\n\n**Here are the audiometric

She has bilateral microtia/atresia. Patient also has a tracheostomy and gastrostomy tube. She did not pass her newborn hearing screening in either ear. Her previous ABR on ******** indicated normal to near normal hearing sensitivity via bone conduction in at least one ear. CMV screening has not been completed.

Results of previous AER on ****** indicated mild hearing loss in both ears. An older sibling and mother reportedly both have hearing loss, but do not use hearing aids. \nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Tympanometry was performed using a 1000 Hz probe. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were tested from 2000-8000 Hz in the left ear.

Father reportedly has a mild hearing loss in one ear only that was identified in his 20s or 30s and is believed to be due to noise exposure. Patient was seen on ********* for a threshold AER following a left ear refer on his newborn hearing screening. Results indicated normal hearing bilaterally, except for a borderline normal threshold at 4k Hz in the left ear. \n\nMEASUREMENTS: Patient was tested in natural sleep. DPOAEs are present at 2000-8000 Hz on the right and absent at all test frequencies in the left (1000-8000 Hz). Tympanometry was obtained using a 1000 Hz tone in each ear. Patient awoke suddenly and did not fall asleep. No results were obtained on the right side.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Tympanometry is consistent with negative middle ear pressure and mobile tympanic membranes bilaterally. Results indicate mild hearing loss rising to within normal range in the left ear.

Bone conduction results indicate there is a conductive component at 1 and 2 KHz, in at least one ear.  Left ear thresholds may be poorer than shown as crossover cannot be ruled out.  Tympanometry is consistent with mobility in each middle ear system.  This degree of hearing loss is sufficient to interfere with speech and language development without intervention.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n-Follow up with pediatric otologist, Dr. ************, on

He passed his newborn hearing screening in the left ear and referred in the right ear. CMV screening was negative. There is no family history of hearing loss. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Patient did not easily maintain a calm sleep state.

He is accompanied by his parents.  History is significant for premature birth (27 weeks) and 3 month NICU stay.  Parents deny family history of childhood hearing loss.  CMV screening was not obtained.  Patient is enrolled in Early Intervention and is receiving OT twice a month.\n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT:  Patient was tested in natural sleep.  Distortion product oto-acoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were present at 2-8 KHz in the right ear and 2-5 and 8 KHz in the left ear.  Tympanometry obtained with 1000 Hz probe.\nINTERPRETATION:  Results indicate normal hearing sensitivity in the right ear and slight conductive hearing loss at 1 KHz, rising to normal hearing at 2-4 KHz in the left ear.  When compared to previous testing from 3/27/24, hearing is stable in the right ear and improved in the left ear at 1-4 KHz.

Patient passed her newborn hearing screening. Her older brother does not have hearing loss at this time. CMV testing was not completed. Genetic testing has been initiated and results are pending.\n\nMEASUREMENTS: Patient was tested in natural sleep.

Medical history includes recurrent middle ear effusion and tubes. Patient understands simple verbal commands. Results of newborn hearing screening are unknown.\n\nMEASUREMENTS: Patient was tested under general anesthesia in OR 10 which is not a sound or electrically treated environment. Tympanometry reveals normal ear canal volumes with flat traces bilaterally. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Tympanometry indicates immobile middle ear systems bilaterally. Results indicate borderline normal rising to within normal range hearing threshold sensitivity in the left ear and mild to moderate conductive hearing loss in the right ear. This degree of hearing is adequate for speech/language development but should be monitored. The right ear would benefit from amplification if hearing cannot be improved medically. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: -Follow up with otolaryngology for middle ear dysfunction and conductive hearing

Prior evaluation on ******* demonstrated mild hearing loss at 1000 Hz rising to normal hearing bilaterally and follow-up on ****** demonstrated moderate rising to mild hearing loss across frequencies for the right ear with no testing obtained on the left side. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. **** awoke during testing of the right ear and did not fall back asleep to obtain hearing thresholds.

A seal could not be obtained to test the right ear despite many attempts with multiple size probe tips.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Tympanometry demonstrates normal middle ear pressure and mobility on the left and hearing is within the normal range from 1000-4000 Hz for the left ear.

He was born full term and passed his newborn hearing screening. Mother reports that ***** does not hear well when she compares his responsiveness to sound to her memories of the behaviors exhibited by her other 6 children at *****'s age. She reports ***** currently has green discharge from both ears. *****'s sister reportedly has unilateral deafness due to a hypoplastic 8th cranial nerve. \n\nMEASUREMENTS: Behavioral hearing evaluation was attempted prior to *****'s scheduled threshold AER. See audiogram for full report. Threshold AER testing was conducted during natural sleep. Tympanometry indicates normal volumes with flat traces bilaterally. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Tympanometry is consistent with immobile middle ear systems bilaterally. Results indicate bilateral moderate conductive hearing loss. His degree of hearing will prevent normal speech/language development if it persists. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: Follow up with otology.

She referred on her newborn hearing screening in the right ear. Patient was born at 35 weeks gestation and has received treatment for hyperbilirubinemia. Her mother denies concerns for hearing sensitivity or a family history of pediatric hearing loss. Patient has already been referred to Early Intervention by her primary care physician. CMV screening was negative.\n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Unmasked bone conduction testing was attempted at 1000 Hz at both 25 and 15 dB HL, but could not be run to completion as baby awoke. Tympanometry results were obtained using a 1000 Hz probe tube. Otoacoustic emissions were deferred due to abnormal tympanometry. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Tympanometry results are consistent with an immobile middle ear system in each ear. *****'s results are consistent with a slight to mild hearing loss at 1000 and 4000 Hz in each ear, type unknown. If persistent, this degree of hearing loss is sufficient to interfere with speech and language development.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n- Monitor hearing via repeat ABR evaluation.

Tympanometry results are consistent with an immobile middle ear system for both ears. Current hearing sensitivity does not allow adequate access to speech sounds for spoken language development and should be monitored closely. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: \n- Repeat ABR is scheduled on

Limited prenatal and postnatal information in Epic. Per chart review, patient passed newborn hearing screening in right ear. Results of CMV screening could not be located in Epic and Care Everywhere. Jaundice was indicated in pediatric notes. Parents deny a history of permanent childhood hearing loss.\n \nMEASURMENTS: Parents state that patient sleeps better in the morning rather than in the afternoon. Father complained that they are not prepared for staying for the test for such a long time. Patient did not sleep well and took a long time to fall asleep. Father had to hold the patient during the entire testing and patient's sleeping position only allowed an access of the ear phone to the left ear. Right ear testing could not be completed as patient woke up and would not fall back to sleep. Auditory Brainstem Waves V were observed at 35 dB from 1k Hz to 4k Hz in left ear. Tympanometry and DPOAE testing could not be completed due to time limitation.\n\nINTERPRETATION: *****'s results are consistent with a mild hearing loss from 1k Hz to 4k Hz in left ear. The nature of the hearing loss is unknown. Results are inconclusive for right ear. Hearing is not adequate for speech and language development in left ear.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: Repeat threshold ABR testing on ********* and follow up with Pedi ENT after.

The patient previously had an auditory brainstem response (ABR) at Dartmouth Hitchcock on ********* which indicated normal hearing in the right ear and a moderate rising to mild hearing loss in the left ear. Tympanometry indicated immobile middle ear systems, bilaterally. CMV screening was not completed. There is no family history of congenital hearing loss. The patient was born at 27 weeks and spent time 17 days in the NICU. He has had an evaluation for Early Intervention services.\n\nMEASUREMTS: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Masked bone conduction for the left ear was attempted, however the patient awoke and would not fall back asleep. Tympanometry with a 1000 Hz probe indicated normal middle ear pressure and tympanic membrane mobility in the right ear and an immobile middle ear system in the left ear. Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAEs) were not tested due to patient noise.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Hearing is within the normal limits in the right ear at 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz and results indicate a moderate rising to mild hearing loss in the left ear. Bone conduction is within the normal range for at least one ear at 1000 Hz. Hearing is adequate, but not optimal, for speech and spoken language development.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: \n- Return for repeat NSP on *********\n- Return for pediatric otolaryngology appointment on

Auditory Brainstem Response testing done on ********* indicated a mild hearing loss in both ears, and another done on ********* indicated a mild hearing loss in the right ear and a moderate hearing loss in the left ear. The patient's parents report no current concerns for hearing. An MRI done ********* indicated bilateral mastoid and middle ear effusions. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Patient would not tolerate probe tip in either ear *****, so therefore distortion product otoacoustic emissions could not be measured due to patient movement and noise. Left ear tympanometry indicated normal middle ear pressure with stiff mobility. Could not measure right tympanometry due to patient movement.  \n\nINTERPRETATION: Compared to his last evaluation on *********, hearing has improved in the left ear across all frequencies tested and in the right ear from 1000-2000 Hz. Hearing sensitivity is within normal limits from 1000-4000 Hz in the left ear and from 1000-8000 Hz in the right ear. Hearing is adequate for normal speech and language development. \n\nRECOMMENDATION: \n- Follow-up with pediatric ENT as scheduled, **********\n- Continue to monitor hearing in conjunction with medical

Patient did not pass the newborn hearing screening for both ears. Patient was born full-term. Mother reports delivery was complicated by preeclampsia. CMV screening was negative. Parents deny a family history of permanent childhood hearing loss. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Tympanometry was completed with 1000 Hz probe tone. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) are presents from 1.5-10k Hz for the right ear and 1.5-7k Hz for the left ear. DPOAEs are absent from 0.5-1k Hz for the right ear and .5-1k, 8k-9k for the left ear. \n\nRESULTS: Tympanometry demonstrates an immobile middle ear system for both ears. ABR test demonstrates a moderate hearing loss, type undetermined, at 1000 Hz for the left ear with normal peripheral hearing sensitivity at 1000 Hz for the left ear and 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz bilaterally.

Distortion product oto-acoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were present and robust at 2-8 KHz.\n\nINTERPRETATION:   Results indicate normal hearing sensitivity in each ear, which is adequate for speech and language development.  The presence of DPOAEs is consistent with normal cochlear outer hair cell function, bilaterally.\n\n**Here are the audiometric test results:**\n\n[\n    {\n        \"TransducerType\": \"AIR\",\n

Recent testing from ******* indicated mild hearing loss in the right ear and was inconclusive for the left ear.  Mother denies family history of permanent childhood hearing loss but did report that several family members received PE tubes before 6 months of age. Mother also reports that she experienced multiple ear infections in the first year of life.  Birth history is unremarkable and CMV screening was negative.  Patient was referred to Early Intervention after the last AER evaluation.\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Tympanometry was obtained using a 1000 Hz probe. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were present from 2-5kHz and absent from 6-8 kHz in the left ear and absent from 2-8 kHz in the right ear. \nINTERPRETATION:   Results indicate mild hearing loss at 1 KHz rising to normal hearing at 2-4 KHz in the left ear and moderate to mild hearing loss, with a conductive component, in the right ear.  Tympanometry results are consistent with immobile middle ear systems in both ears. Presence of DPOAEs in the left ear is consistent with normal cochlear outer hair cell function at frequencies tested.  Absence of DPOAEs in the right ear is consistent with middle ear dysfunction.

The patient spent over 3 months in the NICU and before discharge from the NICU referred in his right ear and passed in his left ear on his newborn hearing screening. CMV screening was negative. The patient had his initial Early Intervention evaluation on ********* and will start services **********. Mother reports a brain MRI done on ******* made an incidental finding of an absence of the bony islands of the horizontal semicircular canals, bilaterally. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were measured in both ears from 2000-8000 Hz, with present responses across all frequencies in the left ear, and absent responses across all frequencies in the right ear. Could not accurately obtain tympanometry *****. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Results indicate borderline-normal to mild hearing loss in the left ear and a moderately-severe-to-severe hearing loss in the right ear. Results of masked bone conduction testing at 1000 Hz indicate the hearing loss in the right ear is likely sensorineural in nature. This degree of hearing loss is sufficient to interfere with normal speech and language development and should be closely monitored. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: \n- Return ********* for repeat Auditory

Father reports the patient does not turn to sounds. Previous ABR from ********** was consistent with normal hearing sensitivity in both ears. No recent history of ear infections or other reported medical changes. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Haitian Creole video interpreter used to facilitate appointment.

He was seen on ********* for an Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) test, which indicated a mild hearing loss in the right ear at 1 kHz and in the left ear at 1 and 4 kHz.

Patient passed the newborn hearing screening for both ears. Patient's mother and father are carriers of GJB2-related nonsyndromic hearing loss. Patient was born at 31 weeks and spent approximately 4 weeks in the NICU. CMV screening was not completed. No family of permanent childhood hearing loss was reported. Patient is enrolled in Early Intervention services. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were tested from 2-10 kHz bilaterally. DPOAEs are present from 2-3.2 kHz and absent from 3.5-10 kHz for the right ear; present from 2.4-4.3 kHz and absent from 2-2.4 and 4.7-10 kHz for the left ear.\n\nINTERPRETATION: ABR test demonstrates normal peripheral hearing sensitivity at 500 Hz, 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz and a mild sensorineural hearing loss at 4000 Hz and 8000 Hz bilaterally. Hearing sensitivity allows adequate access to speech sounds for speech and language development. However, the patient will experience difficulty in noisy listening environments such as the classroom.

She was born at 37 weeks and passed her newborn hearing screening bilaterally. At 1 month of age, patient was brought to the ER with seizure activity. This was later diagnosed as viral meningitis caused by HSV-2. Mother denies concerns for hearing, and she notes that they have to be extremely quiet when the patient is napping or she will wake up. There is no family history of hearing loss. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Additional testing in the left ear could not be completed as patient woke up. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions were attempted, but could not be interpreted due to high noise from patient crying. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Responses were obtained within the normal hearing range at 1000-4000 Hz in the left ear and at 1000-8000 Hz in the right ear. Hearing is currently adequate for speech and language development. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: Consult pediatrician if new concerns arise.\n\n**Here are the audiometric test results:**\n\n[\n    {\n

His previous ABR on ********* revealed a moderate rising to slight hearing loss in the right ear, and a mild rising to slight hearing loss in the left ear; both of unknown etiology. His mother denies otologic changes since his previous appointment. Patient passed his newborn hearing screening.\n\nHEARING MEASUREMENTS: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions were present from 2-8 kHz in the patient's right ear; OAEs were deferred in the left ear due to abnormal tympanometry. Bone conduction testing could not be obtained ***** due to timing.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Tympanometry results are consistent with an immobile middle ear system in the left ear, and normal middle ear pressure and mobility in the right ear. A mild hearing loss, type unknown, is present at 1000 Hz in the the left ear. Hearing sensitivity is normal at 2-4 kHz in the left ear, and across tested frequencies in the right ear.

The patient was born at Lawrence General Hospital without complication and passed his newborn hearing screening at birth. No additional family history of childhood hearing loss not associated with a syndrome. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions were absent in the right ear from 2-8 kHz and could not be tested in the left ear due to excessive patient movement.

Patient did not pass the newborn hearing screening for both ears. Patient was born full-term without pregnancy or birth complications. Parents deny a family history of permanent childhood hearing loss. CMV screening was negative. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT:\nPatient was tested in natural sleep.

Previous results indicated a moderate hearing loss with immobile middle ear systems, bilaterally. CMV screening was negative. Patient has her initial evaluation with Early Intervention scheduled for next week. \n\nMEASUREMENTS: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Tympanometry indicated normal middle ear pressure and normal tympanic membrane mobility in the right ear and normal middle ear pressure with reduced tympanic membrane mobility in the left ear. Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAEs) were measured from 2000-8000 Hz and were absent bilaterally. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Results indicate a mild sloping to moderate sensorineural hearing loss, bilaterally. This degree of hearing loss will affect speech and language development. Patient will benefit from bilateral amplification. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n- Hearing aid fitting following this appointment\n- Return for scheduled pediatric otolaryngology appointment on *********\n-

ABR test completed on ********** demonstrates a moderate to mild hearing loss for both ears, conductive in nature in at least one ear. Per the medical record, patient was born full-term without complications. CMV screening was negative. Mother denies a family history of childhood hearing loss. Mother shared patient's father is a carrier for Type III Usher Syndrome. Patient is enrolled in Early Intervention services. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Tympanometry was completed with a 1000 Hz probe tone for the right ear. Unable to maintain hermetic seal for the left ear. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Results are consistent with a moderate hearing loss at 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz rising to within normal limits at 4000 Hz for the right ear and a moderately-severe rising to moderate hearing loss at 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz for the left ear. Based on unmasked bone conduction results from **********, the hearing loss is conductive in nature in at least one ear. Tympanometry is consistent with an immobile middle ear system for the right ear. If hearing loss persists, it is sufficient to interfere with speech and language development and should be monitored closely. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: \n- Pediatric otolaryngology consultation with

Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) evaluations on ******* and ******** demonstrated mild to moderate hearing loss from 1000-4000 Hz bilaterally. Otolaryngology examination on ******** revealed narrow/stenotic ear canals with a normally appearing tympanic membrane on the right, and the examination could not be completed on the left due to the narrow canal. ****'s mother notes that she currently has a cold/congestion. She has been receiving Early Intervention services. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep with loud nasal breathing and snoring throughout testing. Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions and tympanometry testing were attempted, but a seal could not be maintained, likely due to the stenotic ear canals. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Mild hearing loss from 1000-4000 Hz for the left ear and mild to moderate hearing loss from 1000-4000 Hz for the right ear.

They state that he has never spoken single words and still does not understand simple spoken commands. He communicates by taking a person's hand and leading them to the item he wants. He has never used amplification previously. \n\nMEASUREMENTS: Results were obtained under general anesthesia in MEE OR 5 which is not a sound or electrically treated environment. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Results indicate severe to profound hearing loss in the left ear and a profound hearing loss in the right ear. The hearing loss is likely sensorineural in nature. This degree of hearing will prevent speech and oral language development without intervention and use of devices. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: 1) Amplification; 2) Otology consult, 3) Speech language pathology consult; 4) Teacher of the Deaf consult; 5) Cochlear Implant Evaluation\n\n**Here are the audiometric test results:**\n\n[\n    {\n        \"TransducerType\": \"BONE\",\n        \"Side\":

Her medical history includes premature birth at 25 weeks gestation, a prolonged NICU stay due to premature lungs, and a referral on her newborn hearing screening in the left ear. CMV screening was negative. Her parents report that she is responsive to sounds at home, and deny concerns for medical changes since her previous appointment. She has not yet been seen by pediatric otolaryngology.\n\nHEARING MEASUREMENTS: Patient was tested in natural sleep. She did not remain asleep long enough to obtain further bone conduction information *****. Tympanometry results were consistent with normal middle ear pressure and mobility in the right ear, but testing could not be completed in the left ear due to numerous 'occlusion' readings on this side. This was consistent with tympanometry results at her previous evaluation. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions were not attempted in the right ear due to patient noise level. \n\nINTERPRETATION: *****'s results are consistent with a mild to moderate hearing loss in the left ear, and normal hearing sensitivity in the right ear. Previous masked bone conduction testing indicated a conductive loss on the left side. Hearing is stable in both ears compared to results from **********. Given normal hearing thresholds in the right ear, hearing is adequate for speech and language development, but should continue to be monitored.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n- Consultation with pediatric otolaryngology.

He spent one day in the NICU and his parents report no other health complications. There is no family history of permanent childhood hearing loss. CMV screening was negative.\n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Tympanometry using a 1000 Hz probe tone demonstrated an immobile middle ear system on the left with reduced mobility on the right. Patient awoke before further threshold information could be obtained for the left ear. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Responses were obtained in the normal hearing range from 1000-4000 Hz for the right ear and in the mild hearing loss range from 2000-4000 Hz for the left ear.

Previous testing from ******** indicated normal hearing in the left ear and moderate hearing loss in the right ear with a conductive component.  Patient did not pass the hearing screening bilaterally and CMV screening was negative.  Patient's mom denies birth complications and family history of childhood hearing loss.  \nHEARING MEASUREMENT:  Patient was tested in natural sleep.  Distortion product oto-acoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were present at 2-8 KHz in the left ear and were absent at 2-8 KHz in the right ear.  \nINTERPRETATION: Tympanometry is consistent with negative pressure with normal mobility in the left ear and immobility in the right middle ear.  Results indicate normal hearing at 2-4 KHz with slight hearing loss at 1 KHz in the left ear and moderate hearing loss, rising to mild hearing loss in the right ear.  Masked bone conduction is consistive with a conductive component at 1 KHz in the right ear.  Results are similar to those obtained on ********, except decreased threshold at 1 KHz in both ears.   The presence of DPOAEs is consistent with normal outer hair cell function in the left ear.  Hearing is adequate, but not optimal, for speech and language development and should be monitored.  Patient will benefit from amplification in the right ear if hearing does not improve.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: \n-Consultation with pediatric otologist, Dr. *************, as scheduled.\n-Patient will be

Parents deny a history of hereditary permanent childhood hearing loss.\n\nMEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Auditory Brainstem Responses were observed from 5 to 15 dB in left ear and from 65 to no response at the machine's limits in right ear from 1k Hz to 8k Hz. Unmasked bone responses were obtained at 20 dB Distortion Product . Emissions were present in left ear and absent in right ear from 2k Hz to 8k Hz. Tympanometry with 1k Hz probe tone indicates bilateral normal middle ear function.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Hearing is adequate for speech and language development in left ear with a severe to profound, most likely sensorineural hearing loss in right ear. DPOAE results are consistent with ABR findings. Tympanometry reveals normal middle ear function bilaterally.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: Repeat threshold ABR ************ with Pedi Otology consultation/Amplification is recommended with CNA after repeat

He did not spend time in the NICU. Patient referred in his right ear and passed in his left ear on the initial screen and referred in the left ear and passed in the right ear on the second screening. Patient is being followed for continued jaundice. CMV screening was negative.

Tympanometry is consistent with normal pressure and mobility using 1000Hz probe tone. DPOAEs are present in both ears from 2-8kHz. Patient was referred to Early Intervention.

Patient did not pass the newborn hearing screening in both ears.  He was born via C-section with a four day NICU stay. History is significant for achondroplasia, which was diagnosed prenatally.  CMV screening was negative and there is no family history of childhood hearing loss.  Patient was recently treated for an ear infection in the left ear.  He receives PT through Riverside Early Intervention in Cambridge.\nHEARING MEASUREMENT:  Patient was tested in natural sleep.  Distortion product oto-acoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were present at 2-8 KHz in the right ear and 3-8 KHz in the left ear.  Tympanometry was obtained via 1000 Hz probe.  \nINTERPRETATION:  When compared to previous testing from ********, hearing is stable in both ears.  Results indicate mild hearing loss at 1 KHz, rising to normal hearing at 2-8 KHz in both ears.  There is a conductive component in at least one ear, most likely both.  Tympanometry is consistent with immobility in each middle ear system.  The presence of DPOAEs is consistent with normal outer hair cell function, bilaterally.  This degree of hearing loss may interfere with speech and language development and should be monitored.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n-Consultation with pediatric otology, as scheduled.  Monitor hearing in conjunction with medical management.\n\n**Here are the audiometric test results:**\n\n[\n    {\n        \"TransducerType\": \"BONE\",\n        \"Side\": \"BINAURAL\",\n

He spent 14 days in the NICU due to being born premature. CMV screening was negative. There is no family history of hearing loss. The patient's parents speak Spanish and an interpreter assisted in facilitating communication throughout the appointment.\n\nMEASUREMENTS: Patient was tested in natural sleep.

Patient was born full term without NICU stay. CMV screening was negative per mother. There is no history of hereditary permanent childhood hearing loss. \n\nMEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Auditory Brainstem Responses were observed at 5 dB to 15 dB in left ear from 1k Hz to 8k Hz. With regard to the right ear, masked air threshold was obtained at 85 dB at 1k Hz and no masked response can be obtained at 90 dB from 2k Hz to 4k Hz. Unmasked bone response was obtained at 20 dB at 1k Hz. Masked bone thresholds could not be obtained due to excessive patient's movements. Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions were present in left ear and absent in right ear from 2k Hz to 8k Hz. Tympanometry with 1000 Hz probe tone indicates normal middle ear function bilaterally.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Hearing is normal and adequate for speech and language development in left ear. Possible severe to profound loss and hearing is not adequate for speech and language development in right ear. DPOAE results are consistent with ABR test findings. Tympanometry results are consistent with normal middle ear function in both ears.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: Repeat threshold ABR ************ followed by Ped Otology consultation.

ABR completed on ********** demonstrated a moderate rising to a mild sensorineural hearing loss at 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz for the right ear and a mild sensorineural hearing loss at 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz for the left ear. Patient is enrolled in early intervention services. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT:\nPatient was tested in natural sleep. Bone conduction testing was discontinued as patient woke up. Unable to complete tympanometry due to small ear canals.\n\nRESULTS: \nABR test demonstrates a moderate rising to a mild hearing loss at 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz for the right ear and a mild sloping to a moderate hearing loss from 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz for the left ear. Previous ABR test indicates the hearing loss is sensorineural in nature. This degree of hearing loss is sufficient to interfere with speech and language development without intervention.\n\nINTERPRETATION: \n- Consultation with *************, MD *****. \n- ABR and

The initial Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) evaluation on ******* demonstrated moderate rising to slight conductive hearing loss in the left ear with mild loss rising to normal hearing for the right ear.

Patient referred bilaterally, and then passed in the right ear and referred in the left ear on subsequent screening. He was born at 40W2D gestational age without complication. CMV screening was negative. No known family history of childhood hearing loss. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. He did not return to sleep after attempts for left ear testing began. Tympanometry completed with a 1 kHz probe tone. Distortion product otoacoutsic emissions were tested and absent from 2-10 kHz in the left ear. DPOAEs not attempted in the right ear due to patient awake state. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Results are consistent with a moderate to moderately-severe hearing loss in the right ear; a definitive statement cannot be made regarding hearing sensitivity in the left era. Tympanometry is consistent with immobile middle ear systems bilaterally.

A previous ABR test on ******** revealed normal hearing sensitivity in the right ear and moderate rising to normal hearing thresholds in the left ear. Bone conduction testing could not be obtained at that time due to patient waking up. CMV screening was negative. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENTS: Patient was tested in natural sleep.

Hearing thresholds were otherwise in the normal range. Patient is already receiving Early Intervention services. \n\nMEASUREMENTS: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Despite periods of reasonably deep sleep it was noted that the patient kicked her legs and tried to wave her arms restlessly every 9-45 seconds while sleeping deeply. Transducer seal with the ear was frequently disrupted throughout testing. Tympanometry was performed bilaterally with a 1000 Hz tone. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions are absent at 2 through 10 kHz bilaterally. \n\nINTERPRETATION: \nTympanometry indicates an immobile middle ear system on the left and a stiff middle ear system with negative pressure (-200 daPa) in the right.

This degree of hearing loss may interfere with speech/language development and should be closely monitored. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: \n1. Follow-up with Dr. ***** as scheduled ********\n2. Behavioral audiologic evaluation at 10 months of age, as scheduled on ******\n3. Hearing aids were discussed and, in light of ******'s low to mid-frequency thresholds, are not recommended at this time. Earmolds will occlude ******'s normal/mild hearing thresholds. However, it was emphasized that this recommendation may change in the future pending further behavioral audiologic evaluation and that audiologic monitoring will be recommended at least throughout ******'s childhood \n4. Referral has already been placed for Early Intervention\n5.

Hearing is adequate for speech and language development, but should continue to be monitored for further ear-specific information.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: \n- Repeat natural sleep ABR. This will be scheduled at the Salem office per family preference.\n\n**Here are the audiometric test results:**\n\n[\n    {\n        \"TransducerType\": \"AIR\",\n        \"Side\": \"LEFT\",\n        \"StimType\": \"TONE BURST\",\n        \"Frequency\": 1000,\n        \"DB_HL\": 15,\n        \"Type\": \"THRESHOLD\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"TransducerType\": \"AIR\",\n        \"Side\": \"LEFT\",\n        \"StimType\": \"TONE BURST\",\n        \"Frequency\": 2000,\n        \"DB_HL\": 10,\n        \"Type\": \"THRESHOLD\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"TransducerType\": \"AIR\",\n        \"Side\": \"LEFT\",\n        \"StimType\": \"TONE BURST\",\n        \"Frequency\": 4000,\n        \"DB_HL\": 15,\n        \"Type\": \"THRESHOLD\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"TransducerType\": \"AIR\",\n        \"Side\": \"RIGHT\",\n        \"StimType\": \"TONE BURST\",\n        \"Frequency\": 2000,\n        \"DB_HL\": 15,\n        \"Type\": \"THRESHOLD\"\n    }\n]\n\n**Use the classification template and guidelines** to determine:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"formtype\": \"Redcap\",\n    \"Attributes\": {\n        \"Hearing Type\": {\n            \"Better Ear\": {\n                \"Type\": \"\",\n                \"Degree\": \"\"\n            },\n            \"Left Ear\": {\n                \"Type\": \"\",\n                \"Degree\": \"\"\n            },\n            \"Right Ear\": {\n                \"Type\": \"\",\n                \"Degree\": \"\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"Known Hearing Loss Risk Indicators\": {\n            \"Known Hearing Loss Risk\": \"\",\n            \"Risk Factors\": {\n                \"Tier One\": [],\n                \"Tier Two\": []\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Hearing Type Options:**\n- Type: [\n    \"No hearing loss\",\n    \"Sensorineural\",\n    \"Transient Conductive\",\n    \"Permanent Conductive\",\n    \"Mixed\",\n    \"Auditory Neuropathy\",\n    \"Unknown\"\n]\n- Degree: [\n    \"No hearing loss\",\n    \"Slight (16-25 dB HL)\",\n    \"Mild (26-40 dB HL)\",\n    \"Moderate (41-55 dB HL)\",\n    \"Moderately severe (56-70 dB HL)\",\n    \"Severe (71-90 dB HL)\",\n    \"Profound (91+ dB HL)\",\n    \"Unknown\"\n]\n\n**Known Hearing Loss Risk Indicators:**\n- Options: [\n    \"Yes\",\n    \"No\"\n]\n- Tier One: [\n    \"Aminoglycoside administration for more than 5 days\",\n    \"Atresia\",\n    \"Bacterial meningitis\",\n    \"cCMV\",\n    \"Chemotherapy\",\n    \"Cleft lip/palate\",\n    \"Down syndrome\",\n    \"ECMO\",\n    \"Hyperbilirubinemia with exchange transfusion\",\n    \"Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy\",\n    \"Infection associated with reduced hearing\",\n    \"Maternal Zika infection\",\n    \"Microtia\",\n    \"Other craniofacial anomalies\",\n    \"Parental or medical provider concern\",\n    \"Perinatal asphyxia\",\n    \"Permanent childhood hearing loss in immediate family\",\n    \"Significant head trauma\",\n    \"Syndrome associated with reduced hearing\"\n]\n- Tier Two: [\n    \">10 days mechanical ventilation\",\n    \"< 32 weeks gestational age\",\n    \"< 1500 grams birthweight\",\n    \"Ear pits and/or preauricular tags\",\n    \"History of maternal in utero infection\",\n    \"Permanent childhood hearing loss in extended family\",\n    \"Speech/Language delay\"\n]\n\n**Task:**\n- Fill in missing values using classification rules.\n- Assign the correct 'Better Ear' based on hearing loss severity.\n- Use only valid options listed above (strict validation).\n- Provide **reasoning** for each classification decision.\n- Cite **guideline numbers** used in decisions.\n**Output:**\n- Return the JSON **exactly in the given format**, with values populated.\n- Ensure a `Reasoning` section is added explaining classification decisions.\n- **DO NOT RETURN any commentary or anything else other than the formatted JSON**\n\n**Example Output Format:**\n```json\n{\n    \"formtype\": \"Redcap\",\n    \"Attributes\": {\n        \"Hearing Type\": {\n            \"Better Ear\": {\n                \"Type\": \"Sensorineural\",\n                \"Degree\": \"Moderate (41-55 dB HL)\"\n            },\n            \"Left Ear\": {\n                \"Type\": \"Sensorineural\",\n                \"Degree\": \"Moderate (41-55 dB HL)\"\n            },\n            \"Right Ear\": {\n                \"Type\": \"Sensorineural\",\n                \"Degree\": \"Moderate (41-55 dB HL)\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"Known Hearing Loss Risk Indicators\": {\n            \"Known Hearing Loss Risk\": \"Yes\",\n            \"Risk Factors\": {\n                \"Tier One\": [\"Down syndrome\", \"Bacterial meningitis\"],\n                \"Tier Two\": [\"Speech/Language delay\"]\n            }\n        },\n        \"Reasoning\": \"Patient has moderate sensorineural hearing loss based on threshold levels.

CMV screening was negative. Parents denies a history of ear infection after birth or hereditary permanent childhood hearing loss. \n\nOTOSCOPY: Possible stenotic ear canal in the right ear with preauricular skin tag.\n\nMEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Auditory Brainstem Responses were observed at 15 dB to 25 dB in left ear and at 45 dB to 75 dB in right ear from 1k Hz to 4k Hz. Masked and unmasked bone thresholds were obtained at 15 dB to 25 dB bilaterally. Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions are present from 2k Hz to 8k Hz in left ear. Tympanometry reveals normal middle ear function in left ear. Both tympanometry and DPOAE testing could not be administered for the right ear due to stenotic ear canal. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Hearing is adequate for speech and language development in left ear. A moderate to severe conductive hearing loss is observed in right ear, this degree of loss is not adequate for speech and language development.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: Repeat threshold ABR ************ followed by Ped Otology follow up. If conductive loss is confirmed in right ear, Amplification with BAHA for the right ear/Speech and Language evaluation/Early Intervention/Consultation with an Educational Specialist are recommended.\n\n**Here are the audiometric test results:**\n\n[\n    {\n        \"TransducerType\": \"BONE\",\n        \"Side\": \"BINAURAL\",\n        \"StimType\": \"TONE BURST\",\n

Tympanometry with a 1000Hz probe indicates type A tympanograms on the right. Tympanometry could not be obtained on the left due to \"occlusion.\" A crease and yellow debris could be seen in the left ear canal during otoscopy. Manipulation of the ear did not result in a view that was adequate to determine cerumen occlusion or canal atresia. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Tympanometry indicates normal middle ear pressure and mobility on the right. Results indicate normal hearing thresholds sensitivity in the right and mild conductive hearing loss in the left ear.

CMV screening was negative. Mother denies a history of ear infection after birth or hereditary permanent childhood hearing loss. Patient is diagnosed with achondroplasia prenatally.\n\nMEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Auditory Brainstem Responses were observed at 25 dB at 1k Hz and at 10 to 20 dB from 2k Hz to 8k Hz in right ear and at 30 dB at 1k Hz and at 15 to 20 dB from 2k Hz to 8k Hz in left ear.

Parents deny birth complications that required any special care in NICU stay.  CMV screening was negative.  Patient's mom reports no family history of childhood hearing loss but his dad was adopted and is unsure of family history.  Patient's dad reportedly has an acquired sensorineural hearing loss that progressed to severe to profound levels at age 37, for which he uses a right cochlear implant and a left hearing aid.  \nHEARING MEASUREMENT:  Patient was tested in natural sleep.  Distortion product oto-acoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were present in each ear at 2-8 KHz.  Tympanometry was obtained with 1000 Hz probe.\nINTERPRETATION:  Results indicate normal hearing sensitivity at 1-8 KHz in the right ear and indicate normal hearing sensitivity at 2-4 KHz rising to mild hearing loss at 1 KHz in the left ear.  The presence of DPOAEs is consistent with normal cochlear outer hair cell function, bilaterally.

Initial ABR was limited in results due to a hospital power outage at testing facility. Repeat testing at the Learning Center for the Deaf in Framingham on ********** was consistent with normal hearing sensitivity in the left ear and a severe to profound right hearing loss. CMV screening was negative at birth and there is no known family history of hearing loss. There is a left ear pit. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions are absent in the right ear from 2-8 kHz; unable to complete testing in the left ear due to patient awake state. Tympanometry completed with a 1 kHz probe tone. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Results are consistent with normal hearing sensitivity in the left ear and severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear. Tympanometry is consistent with mobile middle ear systems bilaterally.

CMV screening was negative.  Parents deny birth complications and family history of childhood hearing loss.\nHEARING MEASUREMENT:  Patient was tested in natural sleep.  Distortion product oto-acoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were present and robust in the left ear at 1-6 KHz and absent in the right ear at 1-6 KHz.  Tympanometry was tested with 1000 Hz probe in the right ear and was not obtained for the left ear due to patient crying and movement.\nINTERPRETATION: Results indicate normal hearing sensitivity in the left ear and at least a severe to profound hearing loss in the right ear, type not determined. It is likely that right ear thresholds are a result of crossover from the left ear as masking was not utilized. Further testing is needed to determine the true level of hearing loss in the right ear.  Hearing is adequate for speech and language development, however, the patient will experience communication difficulties in adverse listening situations, such as the presence of background noise and with sound localization. Tympanometry is consistent with mobility in the right middle ear system.

She referred in both ears on her newborn hearing screening. CMV screening was negative. Father reports a family history of hearing loss on his father's side, as his father's cousins have significant hearing loss. Patient underwent her first natural sleep auditory brainstem response testing on *********, which indicated a profound hearing loss in both ears. MRI done on ********* indicated normal inner ear structures and 7th and 8th cranial nerves, bilaterally. Patient has been referred to Early Intervention. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were measured from 2000-10,000 Hz, bilaterally, with absent responses across all frequencies in both ears. Tympanometry indicated normal ear canal volume (0.41 ml right; 0.57 ml left) with normal mobility (0 daPa right, 25 da daPa left) and compliance (0.3 ml right, 0.4 ml left) bilaterally. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Results are consistent with prior testing indicating a profound sensorineural hearing loss in both ears. Absence of DPOAEs indicates abnormal outer hair cell function as well. This degree of hearing loss is sufficient to interfere with normal speech/language development. The patient is expected to receive limited benefit from amplification based on her degree of hearing loss, however may benefit from cochlear implantation. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: \n- Follow-up with pediatric Otology, as scheduled. \n- Hearing aid consultation/trial. \n- Consider cochlear implantation in either or both ears. \n- Speech language evaluation, as scheduled *********.\n- Genetics

Patient did not pass the hearing screening in the left ear. CMV screening was positive. Patient was born at 36 weeks and was admitted to the special care nursery for two days. Patient's mom denies family history of childhood hearing loss. Patient is following with ID physician, Dr. ****************. Mother denies interim history of ear infections\n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Distortion product oto-acoustic emissions were present in the right ear and absent in left ear at 1 to 6 KHz. Tympanometry was obtained with the use of 1k Hz probe tone. Auditory Brainstem Responses were observed at normal hearing level from 1k Hz to 4k Hz in right ear and consistent with a profound hearing loss in left ear. Due to time limitation, tone burst testing at higher levels and testing with clicks could not be attemtped and completed.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Hearing is adequate for speech and language development in right ear and profoundly impaired in left ear. Normal middle ear function bilaterally. DPOAE results are consistent with threshold ABR findings.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: Consultation with pediatric otologist, Dr. *************, on *******; Hearing monitoring with VRA or repeat threshold ABR in conjunction with medical management; Patient is enrolled in EI already and referred to MEE Speech Pathologist and MEE Educational Specialist; Communication Needs Assessment for amplification or

Previous testing from ******* indicated mild hearing loss at 1000 Hz, type not determined.  Patient did not pass the newborn hearing screening in the left ear.  CMV screening was negative and parents deny family history of childhood hearing loss.  Parents report that patient frequently responds to environmental noises.\n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT:  Patient was tested in natural sleep. Distortion product oto-acoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were present in each ear at 1.5-6 KHz.

Results indicate normal hearing sensitivity in the left ear at 1-4 KHz and in the right ear at 1-8 KHz. The presence of DPOAEs is consistent with normal outer hair cell function, bilaterally.

She passed the newborn hearing screening in both ears. Patient was born at 35 weeks and was monitored in the special care nursery for 35 days. She has feeding difficulties and uses a combination of oral and g-tube feedings. Last threshold testing on ******** reveals a mild to moderate hearing loss in each ear, primarily conductive with a sensorineural component at 4k Hz. Mother reports sound alertness and denies an interim history of ear infections. Patient is currently enrolled in EI and expected to start with reconstructive surgeries at 6 month old.\nMEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. *****'s results indicates improved hearing from 1k to 4k Hz in right ear with a persistent mild to moderate loss in left ear. Unmaksed bone results suggest conductive component at 2k Hz and improved neural sesitivity at 4k Hz.

She referred in both ears on her newborn hearing screening. CMV screening was negative. Father reports a family history of hearing loss on his father's side, as his father's cousins have significant hearing loss. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Tympanometry indicates normal middle ear mobility and peak pressure in both ears. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were measured in both ears from 2000-10,000 Hz in both ears, with absent emissions across all frequencies in both ears. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Hearing test results indicate a profound hearing loss in both ears from 1000-4000 Hz. Absence of bone conduction thresholds indicates hearing loss is likely sensorineural. Absence of DPOAEs indicates outer hair cell dysfunction, bilaterally. This degree of hearing loss will interfere with normal speech and language development. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n- Pediatric ENT consultation, scheduled for *****.\n- Repeat natural sleep ABR testing and
