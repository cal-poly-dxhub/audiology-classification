Patient did not pass the newborn hearing screening for both ears. Previous ABR test completed on ********** demonstrates a mild hearing loss at 1000 Hz for the left ear. CMV screening was negative. See previous report for additional case history information. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: \nPatient was tested in natural sleep. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) are present at 1.5, 3-6, 8 and 10 kHz for the right ear and 1.5, 3-6 and 8-10 kHz for the left ear. DPOAEs are absent at 0.5-1, 2, 7 and 9 kHz for the right ear and at 0.5-1, 2 and 7 kHz for the left ear. \n\nRESULTS: Tympanometry demonstrates normal middle ear pressure and mobility for both ears. ABR test demonstrates a mild conductive hearing loss at 1000 Hz and normal peripheral hearing sensitivity at 2000 Hz, 4000 Hz and 8000 Hz for both ears.

Patient's mother has a progressive genetic hearing loss (MYH9).Genetic testing was completed and the patient does not have MYH9. Patient passed her newborn hearing screening. CMV testing was not completed. Results from the ABR completed on ********* indicated a moderate, likely conductive, hearing loss in the right ear and normal hearing in the left ear. Patient is enrolled in Early Intervention. \n\nMEASUREMENTS: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Bone conduction testing was attempted however the patient awoke and did not fall back asleep. Tympanometry indicated immobile middle ear systems in both ears. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Hearing is within the normal range at 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz in the left ear.

His father was reportedly diagnosed with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss in kindergarten.  Father states that hearing aids have been recommended but he never obtained them due to lack of signficant hearing difficulties.

She did not pass her newborn hearing screening in the right ear and CMV screening was negative. Previous ABR results have indicated moderate hearing loss in the right ear and mild rising to normal hearing in the left ear. She is enrolled in Early Intervention services. \n\nMEASUREMENTS: Patient was tested in natural sleep. The patient was seen ***** for the 7:30 ABR slot, but did not sleep. Tympanometry and DPOAEs were completed at that time and indicated normal middle ear status for the right ear and an immobile middle ear system in the left ear. DPOAEs were absent from 2000-8000 Hz in both ears. This provider saw the patient at the 10:30 ABR slot and completed with ABR testing once the patient fell asleep. See the database note for more information. Unmasked bone conduction at 1000 Hz indicates no poorer than a mild hearing loss in one ear, however the patient awoke before testing could be completed.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Results indicate a moderate hearing loss in the right ear and a moderate rising to mild sloping to moderate hearing loss in the left ear. Unmasked bone conduction at 4000 Hz indicates a mild hearing loss in one ear. This degree of hearing loss will interfere with speech and spoken language development. The patient will benefit from use of amplification for at least the right ear. Further testing should be completed to confirm results for the left ear as this is a change from previous results. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n- Consider a sedated ABR to confirm thresholds obtained ***** due to change in responses in the left ear\n- Schedule a follow-up with pediatric otolaryngology\n- Schedule a Communication Needs Assessment at the Salem office\n\n**Here are the audiometric test

Her mother has a history of ear infections, cholesteatoma, and multiple middle ear surgeries as a child. Mother reports that she has no hearing in her left ear and uses a right hearing aid. There are no new concerns for Aliannys' hearing. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were present at 2000-8000 Hz in the right ear. DPOAEs could not be completed on the left ear due to high patient noise. Tympanometry was completed with a 1000 Hz probe tone. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Results are consistent with normal hearing sensitivity bilaterally. Tympanometry suggests mobile middle ear systems bilaterally. Presence of DPOAEs is consistent with good cochlear outer hair cell function and suggests normal to near-normal hearing.

Father reportedly has a mild hearing loss in one ear only that was identified in his 20s or 30s and is believed to be due to noise exposure. Patient was seen on ********* for a threshold AER following a left ear refer on his newborn hearing screening. Results indicated normal hearing bilaterally, except for a borderline normal threshold at 4k Hz in the left ear. \n\nMEASUREMENTS: Patient was tested in natural sleep. DPOAEs are present at 2000-8000 Hz on the right and absent at all test frequencies in the left (1000-8000 Hz). Tympanometry was obtained using a 1000 Hz tone in each ear. Patient awoke suddenly and did not fall asleep. No results were obtained on the right side.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Tympanometry is consistent with negative middle ear pressure and mobile tympanic membranes bilaterally. Results indicate mild hearing loss rising to within normal range in the left ear. Present DPOAEs in the right are consistent with previous results, but threshold AER data could not be confirmed on that side *****. This degree of hearing is adequate for current communication needs, but should be monitored. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: Return for scheduled repeat threshold AER and pediatric ENT consult.\n\n**Here are the

CMV screening was negative. Mother denies a history of permanent childhood hearing loss.\n\nMEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Auditory Brainstem Wave V are observed from 45 dB to 50 dB in right ear and from 55 dB to 70 dB in left ear. Unmasked bone thresholds are estimated at 25 dB at 1k Hz, 30 dB at 2k Hz and NR at 4k Hz. Masked bone threshold was attempted at 2k Hz with masking noise present in right ear. No responses could be elicited at 45 dB with 85 dB contralateral masking. Due to masking dilemma, masked bone thresholds could not be obtained at 1k for both ears and at 2k for right ear. Tympanometry reveals abnormal middle ear function with no ear drum mobility bilaterally.

He passed his newborn hearing screening in the left ear and referred in the right ear. CMV screening was negative. There is no family history of hearing loss. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Patient did not easily maintain a calm sleep state. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were tested at 2000-8000 Hz bilaterally. DPOAEs were present at 3000, 4000, and 6000 Hz in the right ear and present at 3000 Hz in the left ear. All other responses could not be interpreted due to high noise. Tympanometry with a 1000 Hz probe tone suggests some mobility of both middle ear systems. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Results are consisent with a mild hearing loss at 1000-4000 Hz bilaterally, with the exception of normal hearing sensitivity at 2000 Hz in the left ear. If it persists, this degree of hearing loss could adversely affect speech and language development. Hearing should continue to be monitored.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: Repeat testing as scheduled on ***********\n\n**Here are the audiometric test results:**\n\n[\n    {\n        \"TransducerType\":

DPOAEs are absent from 5000-8000 Hz for the left ear. \n\nRESULTS: \nABR test demonstrates normal peripheral hearing sensitivity at 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, 4000 Hz, and 8000 Hz bilaterally. Hearing sensitivity allows adequate access to speech sounds for the development of spoken language. \n\nPLAN: \n- Behavioral hearing evaluation at 12 months old.\n\n**Here are the audiometric test

She spent 23 days in the NICU. She referred in the right ear on her newborn hearing screening. CMV screening was negative. There is no family history of hearing loss. Her parents report that the patient startles to sound at home. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep.

He is accompanied by his parents.  History is significant for premature birth (27 weeks) and 3 month NICU stay.  Parents deny family history of childhood hearing loss.  CMV screening was not obtained.  Patient is enrolled in Early Intervention and is receiving OT twice a month.\n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT:  Patient was tested in natural sleep.  Distortion product oto-acoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were present at 2-8 KHz in the right ear and 2-5 and 8 KHz in the left ear.  Tympanometry obtained with 1000 Hz probe.\nINTERPRETATION:  Results indicate normal hearing sensitivity in the right ear and slight conductive hearing loss at 1 KHz, rising to normal hearing at 2-4 KHz in the left ear.  When compared to previous testing from 3/27/24, hearing is stable in the right ear and improved in the left ear at 1-4 KHz.  Results indicate that hearing is adequate for speech and language development, but should continue to be monitored. Tympanometry is consistent with mobility in each middle ear system.  The presence of DPOAEs is consistent with normal cochlear outer hair cell function.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n-Follow-up with pediatric otologist, Dr. ****************, as scheduled.\n-Return for

Patient passed her newborn hearing screening. Her older brother does not have hearing loss at this time. CMV testing was not completed. Genetic testing has been initiated and results are pending.\n\nMEASUREMENTS: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAES) were measured from 2000-8000 Hz and were present in the left ear and absent in the right ear. Tympanometry revealed an immobile middle ear system in the left ear and results could not be obtained for the right ear due to patient noise.\n\nIMPRESSIONS: Hearing is within the normal range at 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz in the left ear. Hearing thresholds indicate a moderate hearing loss in the right ear at 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. Masked bone conduction was obtained at 1000 Hz for the right ear and was within the normal range, which is consistent with a conductive component for that ear.

Medical history includes recurrent middle ear effusion and tubes. Patient understands simple verbal commands. Results of newborn hearing screening are unknown.\n\nMEASUREMENTS: Patient was tested under general anesthesia in OR 10 which is not a sound or electrically treated environment. Tympanometry reveals normal ear canal volumes with flat traces bilaterally. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Tympanometry indicates immobile middle ear systems bilaterally. Results indicate borderline normal rising to within normal range hearing threshold sensitivity in the left ear and mild to moderate conductive hearing loss in the right ear. This degree of hearing is adequate for speech/language development but should be monitored. The right ear would benefit from amplification if hearing cannot be improved medically. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: -Follow up with otolaryngology for middle ear dysfunction and conductive hearing

Prior evaluation on ******* demonstrated mild hearing loss at 1000 Hz rising to normal hearing bilaterally and follow-up on ****** demonstrated moderate rising to mild hearing loss across frequencies for the right ear with no testing obtained on the left side. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. **** awoke during testing of the right ear and did not fall back asleep to obtain hearing thresholds.

However, there continues to be a moderate rising to mild, most likely conductive, hearing loss. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n- Continue use of Adhear bone conduction device on the left side.\n\n**Here are

He was born full term and passed his newborn hearing screening. Mother reports that ***** does not hear well when she compares his responsiveness to sound to her memories of the behaviors exhibited by her other 6 children at *****'s age. She reports ***** currently has green discharge from both ears. *****'s sister reportedly has unilateral deafness due to a hypoplastic 8th cranial nerve. \n\nMEASUREMENTS: Behavioral hearing evaluation was attempted prior to *****'s scheduled threshold AER. See audiogram for full report. Threshold AER testing was conducted during natural sleep. Tympanometry indicates normal volumes with flat traces bilaterally. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Tympanometry is consistent with immobile middle ear systems bilaterally.

Medical history is significant for cleft lip and palate. CMV screening was not completed. Parents deny concerns for hearing and note that the patient often startles to sound. There is no family history of hearing loss. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were present at 2-8 kHz in the right ear. Left DPOAEs could not be obtained due to patient movement and crying. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Results are consistent with normal hearing sensitivity bilaterally. Hearing is currently adequate for speech and language development.

She referred on her newborn hearing screening in the right ear. Patient was born at 35 weeks gestation and has received treatment for hyperbilirubinemia. Her mother denies concerns for hearing sensitivity or a family history of pediatric hearing loss. Patient has already been referred to Early Intervention by her primary care physician. CMV screening was negative.\n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Unmasked bone conduction testing was attempted at 1000 Hz at both 25 and 15 dB HL, but could not be run to completion as baby awoke. Tympanometry results were obtained using a 1000 Hz probe tube. Otoacoustic emissions were deferred due to abnormal tympanometry. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Tympanometry results are consistent with an immobile middle ear system in each ear. *****'s results are consistent with a slight to mild hearing loss at 1000 and 4000 Hz in each ear, type unknown.

His parents report that he appears responsive to speech and environmental sounds. ******* passed the newborn hearing screening bilaterally and CMV screening was negative. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep and awoke multiple times during testing. ******* breathes loudly/snores during sleep as an effect of his cleft palate. Tympanometry testing was performed using a 1000 Hz probe tone, but a tracing could not be interpreted for the right ear due to patient movement. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Mild hearing loss at 1000 Hz rising to normal hearing from 2000-4000 Hz for the right ear with moderate hearing loss at 1000 Hz rising to normal hearing at 4000 Hz for the left ear. Normal bone conduction responses at 1000 Hz during the last evaluation indicate the loss is conductive in nature. Tympanometry testing demonstrated an immobile middle ear system on the left side *****. This degree of hearing loss may interfere with speech/language development if left untreated. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Follow-up with Dr. ******** as scheduled ***** 2.

Patient's mother has acquired hearing loss in childhood resulting from complications secondary to an ear infection; she wears a right hearing aid. Patient passed her newborn hearing screening in both ears and was born full-term without complications. No other family history of childhood hearing loss.\n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were tested from 2-8 kHz in both ears; they were present in the right ear at all tested frequencies and present from 4-5 kHz in the left ear. Tympanometry completed with a 1 kHz probe tone. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Results are consistent with normal hearing sensitivity in the right ear and in the left ear at 4 kHz; mild hearing loss identified in the left ear at 1 and 2 kHz. Tympanometry was consistent with a mobile right and immobile left middle ear system. Hearing is adequate for speech and language development, but should continue to be monitored. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: \n- Repeat ABR on **********\n\n**Here are the audiometric test results:**\n\n[\n

Limited prenatal and postnatal information in Epic. Per chart review, patient passed newborn hearing screening in right ear. Results of CMV screening could not be located in Epic and Care Everywhere. Jaundice was indicated in pediatric notes. Parents deny a history of permanent childhood hearing loss.\n \nMEASURMENTS: Parents state that patient sleeps better in the morning rather than in the afternoon. Father complained that they are not prepared for staying for the test for such a long time. Patient did not sleep well and took a long time to fall asleep. Father had to hold the patient during the entire testing and patient's sleeping position only allowed an access of the ear phone to the left ear. Right ear testing could not be completed as patient woke up and would not fall back to sleep. Auditory Brainstem Waves V were observed at 35 dB from 1k Hz to 4k Hz in left ear. Tympanometry and DPOAE testing could not be completed due to time limitation.\n\nINTERPRETATION: *****'s results are consistent with a mild hearing loss from 1k Hz to 4k Hz in left ear. The nature of the hearing loss is unknown. Results are inconclusive for right ear. Hearing is not adequate for speech and language development in left ear.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: Repeat threshold ABR testing on ********* and follow up with Pedi ENT after.

Patient is fit with binaural amplification. Mother does not report concern regarding patient's speech/language development. Patient had an ear examination under anesthesia prior to *****'s hearing evaluation. Patient has a ventilation tube in place on the right side, and the left ventilation tube was removed with resultant 1.5mm perforation of the tympanic membrane.\n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested under general anesthesia in OR 9, which is not a sound-treated or electrically shielded environment. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Results are consistent with a mild/moderate sensorineural hearing loss in both ears. Unmasked bone conduction testing at 500 Hz suggests there may be a \"cookie-bite\" configuration to patient's hearing loss. This degree of hearing loss will interfere with speech/language development. The patient will continue to benefit from use of binaural amplification.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n-Hearing aid service for device check and possible reprogramming, as scheduled\n-Follow up audiogram and

The patient previously had an auditory brainstem response (ABR) at Dartmouth Hitchcock on ********* which indicated normal hearing in the right ear and a moderate rising to mild hearing loss in the left ear. Tympanometry indicated immobile middle ear systems, bilaterally. CMV screening was not completed. There is no family history of congenital hearing loss. The patient was born at 27 weeks and spent time 17 days in the NICU. He has had an evaluation for Early Intervention services.\n\nMEASUREMTS: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Masked bone conduction for the left ear was attempted, however the patient awoke and would not fall back asleep. Tympanometry with a 1000 Hz probe indicated normal middle ear pressure and tympanic membrane mobility in the right ear and an immobile middle ear system in the left ear. Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAEs) were not tested due to patient noise.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Hearing is within the normal limits in the right ear at 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz and results indicate a moderate rising to mild hearing loss in the left ear. Bone conduction is within the normal range for at least one ear at 1000 Hz. Hearing is adequate, but not optimal, for speech and spoken language development.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: \n- Return for repeat NSP on *********\n- Return for pediatric otolaryngology appointment on

Patient was born at Emerson Hospital. Mother was unsure of the results of CMV testing and plans to follow-up with the pediatrician. Mother reports her daughter, *******, and herself have an identical hearing loss; her daughter's was identified at birth. Neither have ever utilized hearing technology.\n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Of the scheduled 180 minute appointment, patient fell asleep with only 15 minutes remaining of scheduled time. Tympanometry completed in the left ear with a 1 kHz probe tone; unable to maintain a hermetic seal in right ear with patient movement. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions were tested from 2-8 kHz bilaterally.

The patient's parents report no current concerns for hearing. An MRI done ********* indicated bilateral mastoid and middle ear effusions. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep.

He was born full term and did not spend any time in the NICU. His mother denies a family history of hearing loss. She reports that ***** reacts to sounds at home. CMV screening was negative.\n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep.

Right hearing at 1000 Hz is borderline normal. Hearing is currently adequate for speech and language development.

Tympanometry with a 1000 Hz probe tone revealed middle ear mobility in both ears *****, with possible Eustachian tube dysfunction in the left ear. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were present and robust at 2000-8000 Hz bilaterally. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Responses were obtained within the normal hearing range at 1000-4000 Hz bilaterally. Hearing is currently adequate for speech and language development. Presence of DPOAEs is consistent with normal cochlear outer hair cell function and suggests normal to near-normal hearing. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: Follow-up with pediatric otology as scheduled.\n\n**Here

Patient did not pass the newborn hearing screening for the right ear initially, then did not pass for the left ear on the second attempt. ABR test completed on ********** demonstrated a mild hearing loss at 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz bilaterally, type undetermined. Mother shared the patient's father has a hearing loss in the right ear, type unknown, diagnosed in his early twenties. Patient was born at 36 weeks gestation via caesarian section. Patient was followed for jaundice. CMV screening was negative. Of recent note, patient was admitted to Boston Children's Hospital in December 2023 for inguinal suppurative lymphadenitis due to Staph infection. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Tympanometry completed with 1000 Hz probe tone demonstrates normal eardrum mobility bilaterally. Distortion production otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) are present from 3000-8000 Hz for the right ear and 2000-8000 Hz for the left ear.

Recent testing from ******* indicated mild hearing loss in the right ear and was inconclusive for the left ear.  Mother denies family history of permanent childhood hearing loss but did report that several family members received PE tubes before 6 months of age. Mother also reports that she experienced multiple ear infections in the first year of life.  Birth history is unremarkable and CMV screening was negative.  Patient was referred to Early Intervention after the last AER evaluation.\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Tympanometry was obtained using a 1000 Hz probe. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were present from 2-5kHz and absent from 6-8 kHz in the left ear and absent from 2-8 kHz in the right ear. \nINTERPRETATION:   Results indicate mild hearing loss at 1 KHz rising to normal hearing at 2-4 KHz in the left ear and moderate to mild hearing loss, with a conductive component, in the right ear.  Tympanometry results are consistent with immobile middle ear systems in both ears. Presence of DPOAEs in the left ear is consistent with normal cochlear outer hair cell function at frequencies tested.  Absence of DPOAEs in the right ear is consistent with middle ear dysfunction.

The patient spent over 3 months in the NICU and before discharge from the NICU referred in his right ear and passed in his left ear on his newborn hearing screening. CMV screening was negative. The patient had his initial Early Intervention evaluation on ********* and will start services **********. Mother reports a brain MRI done on ******* made an incidental finding of an absence of the bony islands of the horizontal semicircular canals, bilaterally. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were measured in both ears from 2000-8000 Hz, with present responses across all frequencies in the left ear, and absent responses across all frequencies in the right ear. Could not accurately obtain tympanometry *****. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Results indicate borderline-normal to mild hearing loss in the left ear and a moderately-severe-to-severe hearing loss in the right ear. Results of masked bone conduction testing at 1000 Hz indicate the hearing loss in the right ear is likely sensorineural in nature. This degree of hearing loss is sufficient to interfere with normal speech and language development and should be closely monitored. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: \n- Return ********* for repeat Auditory Brainstem Response test.\n- Pediatric Otology consult on *******.\n- Speech/language evaluation with *************, M.S., CCC-SLP\n\n**Here are the audiometric test results:**\n\n[\n    {\n

She is diagnosed with Phelan-McDermid 22q13 deletion syndrome and has a history of right sided cholesteatoma with surgery for removal in August of 2023. It is noted that the incus and head of the malleus were encased in cholesteatoma and were therefore removed during surgery.\n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Testing was completed in OR 8, which is not a sound-treated or electrically shielded environment. A higher than typical amount of electrical interference was noted during *****'s test, resulting in the need for extended averaging of waveforms. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Results indicate a normal/borderline normal hearing sensitivity in the left ear and a moderate mixed hearing loss in the right ear. The patient is expected to experience communication difficulty in adverse listening situations, such as in the presence of background noise.

He referred bilaterally on his newborn hearing screening. His mother denies a family history of hearing loss. She notes that the patient will startle to loud sounds. Mother reports the patient has a lot of nasal congestion. CMV screening was negative.\n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep.

He is accompanied by his parents and grandmother.  Previous results indicated mild sensorineural hearing loss in each ear.  CMV screening was negative.  Parents deny family history of childhood hearing loss.  Patient was referred to Early Intervention after the last evaluation.\n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep.

On his initial hearing screening, he referred in both ears, and on the second screening he passed in the right and referred in the left. His mother denies concerns for hearing, and she notes that the patient often startles to sounds. There is no family history of hearing loss. \nCMV screening was completed on **********, and results were negative. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep.

The patient was born at Lawrence General Hospital without complication and passed his newborn hearing screening at birth. No additional family history of childhood hearing loss not associated with a syndrome. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions were absent in the right ear from 2-8 kHz and could not be tested in the left ear due to excessive patient movement. Tympanometry was completed with a 1 kHz probe tone. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Results are consistent with mild hearing loss at 1 kHz and hearing within normal limits at 2 and 4 kHz bilaterally.

Patient referred in left ear at newborn hearing screening. CMV screening was negative. Parents deny concerns regarding hearing or an interim history of ear infection since last visit.\n\nMEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Patient did not sleep long, as a result tracings were not collected at a lower stimulus level for the right ear. Auditory Brainstem Respones were observed from 10 to 15 dB i right ear and from 5 to 25 dB in left ear from 1k to 8k Hz. Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions were present from 2k to 5k Hz bilaterally.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Hearing is adequate for speech and language development bilaterally with the exception of borderline normal hearing at 8k Hz in left ear.

Patient did not pass the newborn hearing screening for both ears. Patient was born full-term without pregnancy or birth complications. Parents deny a family history of permanent childhood hearing loss. CMV screening was negative. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT:\nPatient was tested in natural sleep. Tympanometry was completed with 1000 Hz probe tone. \n\nINTERPRETATION: \nTympanometry is consistent with normal middle ear mobility for both ears. ABR test demonstrates a mild hearing loss at 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz for the right ear and a mild to moderate hearing loss at 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz. The hearing loss is conductive in at least one ear at 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz. This degree of hearing loss is not adequate for speech and language development and should be monitored closely. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: \n- Repeat ABR at 4 months old followed by consultation with

Patient's mother reports that she was diagnosed with a bilateral permanent hearing loss as a teenager. She does not wear hearing aids. Patient has two siblings who have not been formally tested but have no known hearing issues. There are no other known risk factors for hearing loss.\n\nMEASUREMENTS: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Patient was tested at 1,2, and 4kHz in the right ear and at 1,2,4, and 8 kHz in the left ear with within normal responses at all tested frequencies. Patient's Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAEs) were tested 1-6kHz in both ears and were present and robust in both ears.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Patient's hearing is adequate for speech and language acquisition. Present DPOAEs are consistent with good cochlear outer haircell motility. Due to immediate family history of early onset hearing loss, patient's hearing should be tested regularly. She will be scheduled to return at 12 months of age.\n\n**Here are the audiometric test results:**\n\n[\n    {\n        \"TransducerType\": \"AIR\",\n        \"Side\": \"LEFT\",\n        \"StimType\":

ABR test completed on ********** demonstrates a moderate to mild hearing loss for both ears, conductive in nature in at least one ear. Per the medical record, patient was born full-term without complications. CMV screening was negative. Mother denies a family history of childhood hearing loss. Mother shared patient's father is a carrier for Type III Usher Syndrome. Patient is enrolled in Early Intervention services. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Tympanometry was completed with a 1000 Hz probe tone for the right ear. Unable to maintain hermetic seal for the left ear. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Results are consistent with a moderate hearing loss at 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz rising to within normal limits at 4000 Hz for the right ear and a moderately-severe rising to moderate hearing loss at 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz for the left ear. Based on unmasked bone conduction results from **********, the hearing loss is conductive in nature in at least one ear.

Patient did not pass the newborn hearing screening in her left ear x2. Evaluation on 10/13/23 revealed within normal responses in the right ear and a severe hearing loss in the left ear with within normal tympanometry in both ears. There are no known risk factors for hearing loss. Mother reports that Early Intervention has been in contact with the family.\n\nMEASUREMENTS: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Bone conduction was performed at 2 and 4 kHz in the left ear with a masked right ear as well as air conduction in the left ear at 1,2, and 4 kHz with a masked right ear.  Bone conduction testing revealed no response at 60 dB at 2 and 4kHz. The masked left ear responses for air were in the profound loss range.

Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) evaluations on ******* and ******** demonstrated mild to moderate hearing loss from 1000-4000 Hz bilaterally.

Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAEs) were measured and absent from 2000-8000 Hz, bilaterally. Tympanometry was completed using a 1000 Hz probe tone and results indicated normal middle ear pressure and tympanic membrane mobility. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Results indicate a severe to profound hearing loss in both ears. There was no response at the limits of the equipment for bone conduction at 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz indicating the hearing loss is likely sensorineural. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: \n- Return for

Her medical history includes premature birth at 25 weeks gestation, a prolonged NICU stay due to premature lungs, and a referral on her newborn hearing screening in the left ear. CMV screening was negative. Her parents report that she is responsive to sounds at home, and deny concerns for medical changes since her previous appointment. She has not yet been seen by pediatric otolaryngology.\n\nHEARING MEASUREMENTS: Patient was tested in natural sleep. She did not remain asleep long enough to obtain further bone conduction information *****. Tympanometry results were consistent with normal middle ear pressure and mobility in the right ear, but testing could not be completed in the left ear due to numerous 'occlusion' readings on this side. This was consistent with tympanometry results at her previous evaluation. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions were not attempted in the right ear due to patient noise level. \n\nINTERPRETATION: *****'s results are consistent with a mild to moderate hearing loss in the left ear, and normal hearing sensitivity in the right ear. Previous masked bone conduction testing indicated a conductive loss on the left side. Hearing is stable in both ears compared to results from **********. Given normal hearing thresholds in the right ear, hearing is adequate for speech and language development, but should continue to be monitored.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n- Consultation with pediatric otolaryngology.

Previous testing from ******** indicated normal hearing in the left ear and moderate hearing loss in the right ear with a conductive component.  Patient did not pass the hearing screening bilaterally and CMV screening was negative.  Patient's mom denies birth complications and family history of childhood hearing loss.  \nHEARING MEASUREMENT:  Patient was tested in natural sleep.  Distortion product oto-acoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were present at 2-8 KHz in the left ear and were absent at 2-8 KHz in the right ear.  \nINTERPRETATION: Tympanometry is consistent with negative pressure with normal mobility in the left ear and immobility in the right middle ear.  Results indicate normal hearing at 2-4 KHz with slight hearing loss at 1 KHz in the left ear and moderate hearing loss, rising to mild hearing loss in the right ear.  Masked bone conduction is consistive with a conductive component at 1 KHz in the right ear.  Results are similar to those obtained on ********, except decreased threshold at 1 KHz in both ears.   The presence of DPOAEs is consistent with normal outer hair cell function in the left ear.  Hearing is adequate, but not optimal, for speech and language development and should be monitored.

Patient's mother reports that she does not appear to startle to loud sounds. The patient passed her newborn hearing screening bilaterally. Family history is positive for hearing loss; patient's father was identified with unilateral hearing loss in preschool. Mother reports father has not been recommended use of a hearing aid, but notes an implant was brought up as an option for his hearing loss.\n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions are present in the right ear and absent in the left ear from 2-5 kHz. Tympanometry completed with a 1 kHz probe tone.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Results are consistent with normal hearing sensitivity in the right ear and a mild hearing loss in the left ear. Tympanometry is consistent with normal mobility in the right ear and an immobile left middle ear system. Hearing is adequate for speech and language development; however, it should continue to be monitored. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n- Otologic consult as scheduled *****\n- Behavioral audiogram at 9 months

At birth, his mother spiked a fever and there was concern for chorioamnionitis, so patient was monitored in the NICU for 2 days. He referred in the left ear on his newborn hearing screening. CMV screening was negative. Parents report that patient will startle to sounds at home. He has recently had bronchitis and some nasal congestion.\n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Tympanometry indicated some middle ear mobility in both ears. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions were attempted, but could not be interpreted due to high noise. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Results are consistent with mild sensorineural hearing loss bilaterally. Patient was referred to Early Intervention.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: 1) Consultation with pediatric otology. This was set up for the parents. 2) Re-test hearing in *** weeks.

Patient did not pass the newborn hearing screening in both ears.  He was born via C-section with a four day NICU stay. History is significant for achondroplasia, which was diagnosed prenatally.  CMV screening was negative and there is no family history of childhood hearing loss.  Patient was recently treated for an ear infection in the left ear.  He receives PT through Riverside Early Intervention in Cambridge.\nHEARING MEASUREMENT:  Patient was tested in natural sleep.  Distortion product oto-acoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were present at 2-8 KHz in the right ear and 3-8 KHz in the left ear.  Tympanometry was obtained via 1000 Hz probe.  \nINTERPRETATION:  When compared to previous testing from ********, hearing is stable in both ears.  Results indicate mild hearing loss at 1 KHz, rising to normal hearing at 2-8 KHz in both ears.  There is a conductive component in at least one ear, most likely both.  Tympanometry is consistent with immobility in each middle ear system.  The presence of DPOAEs is consistent with normal outer hair cell function, bilaterally.  This degree of hearing loss may interfere with speech and language development and should be monitored.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n-Consultation with pediatric otology, as scheduled.

Masked air conduction thresholds were obtained at 90 dB at 1k and 2k Hz and no response could be elicited at 95 dB at 4k Hz in right ear. Hearing is at 5 dB to 15 dB from 1k Hz to 4k Hz in left ear. Masked bone thresholds and Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emission testing could not be completed as patient woke up and would not fall back to sleep. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Adequate hearing for speech and language development for left ear and a severe to profound loss in right ear.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: Continue follow up with Pedi ENT/CNA with Pedi audiologists for a trial with amplification/Consultation with an Educational Specialist/ Hearing monitoring through behavioral testing after completion of imaging studies.\n\n**Here are the audiometric test results:**\n\n[\n

Patient was born full term without NICU stay. CMV screening was negative per mother. There is no history of hereditary permanent childhood hearing loss. \n\nMEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Auditory Brainstem Responses were observed at 5 dB to 15 dB in left ear from 1k Hz to 8k Hz. With regard to the right ear, masked air threshold was obtained at 85 dB at 1k Hz and no masked response can be obtained at 90 dB from 2k Hz to 4k Hz. Unmasked bone response was obtained at 20 dB at 1k Hz. Masked bone thresholds could not be obtained due to excessive patient's movements. Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions were present in left ear and absent in right ear from 2k Hz to 8k Hz.

Patient's father was reportedly born with profound, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and her mom acquired profound, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, identified at 19 months and attributed to bacterial meningitis.  Her paternal uncle was also born with bilateral, profound hearing loss.  Patient passed the newborn hearing screening in both ears and patient's mom denies birth complications.  She was recently hospitalized for ***.\n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT:  Patient was tested in natural sleep.   Distortion product oto-acoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were present at 3-8 KHz in the left ear and 3-5 KHz in the right ear.\n\nINTERPRETATION:  Results indicate normal hearing sensitivity in the right ear at 1-4 KHz and the left ear at 1-8 KHz.  The presence of DPOAEs is consistent with normal cochlear outer hair cell function.  Hearing is adequate for speech and language development.   \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n-Return for monitoring behavioral hearing test at 9 months of age.\n\n**Here are the audiometric test results:**\n\n[\n

A previous ABR test on ******** revealed normal hearing sensitivity in the right ear and moderate rising to normal hearing thresholds in the left ear. Bone conduction testing could not be obtained at that time due to patient waking up. CMV screening was negative. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENTS: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Tympanometry using a 1000 Hz tone demonstrates normal eardrum mobility in the right ear and an immobile middle ear system in the left.\n\nINTERPRETATION: \nABR responses show normal hearing sensitivity at 1000 and 2000 Hz in the right ear with moderate rising to mild hearing loss at 1000, 2000, and 4000 in the left ear. Hearing loss is conductive at 1000 and 2000 Hz in the left ear. ABR is stable when compared to the previous evaluation.

Hearing thresholds were otherwise in the normal range. Patient is already receiving Early Intervention services. \n\nMEASUREMENTS: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Despite periods of reasonably deep sleep it was noted that the patient kicked her legs and tried to wave her arms restlessly every 9-45 seconds while sleeping deeply. Transducer seal with the ear was frequently disrupted throughout testing. Tympanometry was performed bilaterally with a 1000 Hz tone.

Patient's mother has not yet had a diagnostic hearing evaluation, but she perceives high frequency hearing loss and difficulty hearing in background noise. ****** was evaluated by Dr. ***** and a referral was placed to genetics. CMV screening to be completed via stored cord blood. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. He awoke while testing 8000 Hz for the right ear and did not return to sleep for bone conduction testing to be completed. Tympanometry testing using a 1000 Hz probe tone demonstrated middle ear mobility bilaterally. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Normal hearing from 1000-2000 Hz sloping to mild to moderate hearing loss through 8000 Hz for the right ear. Given normal tympanometric findings and that ******'s parents carry the GJB2 mutation, this hearing loss is suspected to be sensorineural in nature. This degree of hearing loss may interfere with speech/language development and should be closely monitored. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: \n1. Follow-up with Dr. ***** as scheduled ********\n2. Behavioral audiologic evaluation at 10 months of age, as scheduled on ******\n3. Hearing aids were discussed and, in light of ******'s low to mid-frequency thresholds, are not recommended at this time. Earmolds will occlude ******'s normal/mild hearing thresholds.

This will be scheduled at the Salem office per family preference.\n\n**Here are the audiometric test results:**\n\n[\n    {\n        \"TransducerType\": \"AIR\",\n        \"Side\": \"LEFT\",\n        \"StimType\": \"TONE BURST\",\n        \"Frequency\": 1000,\n        \"DB_HL\": 15,\n        \"Type\": \"THRESHOLD\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"TransducerType\": \"AIR\",\n        \"Side\": \"LEFT\",\n        \"StimType\": \"TONE BURST\",\n        \"Frequency\": 2000,\n        \"DB_HL\": 10,\n        \"Type\": \"THRESHOLD\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"TransducerType\": \"AIR\",\n        \"Side\": \"LEFT\",\n        \"StimType\": \"TONE BURST\",\n        \"Frequency\": 4000,\n        \"DB_HL\": 15,\n        \"Type\": \"THRESHOLD\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"TransducerType\": \"AIR\",\n        \"Side\": \"RIGHT\",\n        \"StimType\": \"TONE BURST\",\n        \"Frequency\": 2000,\n        \"DB_HL\": 15,\n        \"Type\": \"THRESHOLD\"\n    }\n]\n\n**Use the classification template and guidelines** to determine:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"formtype\": \"Redcap\",\n    \"Attributes\": {\n        \"Hearing Type\": {\n            \"Better Ear\": {\n                \"Type\": \"\",\n                \"Degree\": \"\"\n            },\n            \"Left Ear\": {\n                \"Type\": \"\",\n                \"Degree\": \"\"\n            },\n            \"Right Ear\": {\n                \"Type\": \"\",\n                \"Degree\": \"\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"Known Hearing Loss Risk Indicators\": {\n            \"Known Hearing Loss Risk\": \"\",\n            \"Risk Factors\": {\n                \"Tier One\": [],\n                \"Tier Two\": []\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Hearing Type Options:**\n- Type: [\n    \"No hearing loss\",\n    \"Sensorineural\",\n    \"Transient Conductive\",\n    \"Permanent Conductive\",\n    \"Mixed\",\n    \"Auditory Neuropathy\",\n    \"Unknown\"\n]\n- Degree: [\n    \"No hearing loss\",\n    \"Slight (16-25 dB HL)\",\n    \"Mild (26-40 dB HL)\",\n    \"Moderate (41-55 dB HL)\",\n    \"Moderately severe (56-70 dB HL)\",\n    \"Severe (71-90 dB HL)\",\n    \"Profound (91+ dB HL)\",\n    \"Unknown\"\n]\n\n**Known Hearing Loss Risk Indicators:**\n- Options: [\n    \"Yes\",\n    \"No\"\n]\n- Tier One: [\n    \"Aminoglycoside administration for more than 5 days\",\n    \"Atresia\",\n    \"Bacterial meningitis\",\n    \"cCMV\",\n    \"Chemotherapy\",\n    \"Cleft lip/palate\",\n    \"Down syndrome\",\n    \"ECMO\",\n    \"Hyperbilirubinemia with exchange transfusion\",\n    \"Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy\",\n    \"Infection associated with reduced hearing\",\n    \"Maternal Zika infection\",\n    \"Microtia\",\n    \"Other craniofacial anomalies\",\n    \"Parental or medical provider concern\",\n    \"Perinatal asphyxia\",\n    \"Permanent childhood hearing loss in immediate family\",\n    \"Significant head trauma\",\n    \"Syndrome associated with reduced hearing\"\n]\n- Tier Two: [\n    \">10 days mechanical ventilation\",\n    \"< 32 weeks gestational age\",\n    \"< 1500 grams birthweight\",\n    \"Ear pits and/or preauricular tags\",\n    \"History of maternal in utero infection\",\n    \"Permanent childhood hearing loss in extended family\",\n    \"Speech/Language delay\"\n]\n\n**Task:**\n- Fill in missing values using classification rules.\n- Assign the correct 'Better Ear' based on hearing loss severity.\n- Use only valid options listed above (strict validation).\n- Provide **reasoning** for each classification decision.\n- Cite **guideline numbers** used in decisions.\n**Output:**\n- Return the JSON **exactly in the given format**, with values populated.\n- Ensure a `Reasoning` section is added explaining classification decisions.\n- **DO NOT RETURN any commentary or anything else other than the formatted JSON**\n\n**Example Output Format:**\n```json\n{\n    \"formtype\": \"Redcap\",\n    \"Attributes\": {\n        \"Hearing Type\": {\n            \"Better Ear\": {\n                \"Type\": \"Sensorineural\",\n                \"Degree\": \"Moderate (41-55 dB HL)\"\n            },\n            \"Left Ear\": {\n                \"Type\": \"Sensorineural\",\n                \"Degree\": \"Moderate (41-55 dB HL)\"\n            },\n            \"Right Ear\": {\n                \"Type\": \"Sensorineural\",\n                \"Degree\": \"Moderate (41-55 dB HL)\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"Known Hearing Loss Risk Indicators\": {\n            \"Known Hearing Loss Risk\": \"Yes\",\n            \"Risk Factors\": {\n                \"Tier One\": [\"Down syndrome\", \"Bacterial meningitis\"],\n                \"Tier Two\": [\"Speech/Language delay\"]\n            }\n        },\n        \"Reasoning\": \"Patient has moderate sensorineural hearing loss based on threshold levels.

CMV screening was negative. Parents denies a history of ear infection after birth or hereditary permanent childhood hearing loss. \n\nOTOSCOPY: Possible stenotic ear canal in the right ear with preauricular skin tag.\n\nMEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Auditory Brainstem Responses were observed at 15 dB to 25 dB in left ear and at 45 dB to 75 dB in right ear from 1k Hz to 4k Hz. Masked and unmasked bone thresholds were obtained at 15 dB to 25 dB bilaterally. Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions are present from 2k Hz to 8k Hz in left ear.

Patient's mother has not had a diagnostic hearing evaluation, but states that a hearing screening App on her cell phone indicated some degree of high frequency hearing loss. CMV screening was not completed as the patient passed his newborn hearing screening. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. ****** did not fall asleep for over 90 minutes of the appointment and his mother notes he takes 20-30 minute naps at a time. Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions measured from 1000-8000 Hz are present only at 1500 Hz for the left ear and from 1500-2000 Hz for the right ear. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Responses were obtained within the normal hearing range at 1000 Hz sloping to mild hearing loss through 4000 Hz and moderate hearing loss at 8000 Hz for the left ear.

CMV screening was negative. Mother reports startling behaviors and denies a family history of permanent childhood hearing loss.\n\nMEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Auditory Brainstem Responses were observed at 5 to 15 dB in the left ear and at 35 to 50 dB in the right ear. Unmasked bone thresholds were obtained at 20 dB for 1k and 2k Hz. Masked bone thresholds were obtained at 35 dB at 1k Hz and 30 dB at 2k Hz. Tympanometry with 1k Hz probe tone suggested normal middle ear function in left ear and abnormal middle ear function in right ear.

An MRI was performed on ******* that was negative for inner ear or auditory nerve anomalies. Her mother and maternal grandfather deny concerns since her previous evaluation. Patient is connected with Early Intervention, and has an auditory rehabilitation evaluation scheduled on *******. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENTS: Patient was tested in natural sleep. No responses were obtained at 90 dB in the left ear from 1-4 kHz; higher tracings could not be completed as patient woke to increased masking levels. Bone conduction responses could not be obtained ***** due to time limitations. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions could not be repeated ***** due to patient noise level. \n\nINTERPRETATION: *****'s results are consistent with a profound hearing loss in the left ear, and normal hearing sensitivity in the right ear. Hearing is adequate but not optimal for speech and language development, and should continue to be monitored. \n\nPatient and maternal grandfather were counseled on the patient's possible candidacy for cochlear implantation. They plan to discuss this more with her ENT.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n- Behavioral audiogram at 9 months scheduled on ********, given stable hearing in the right ear across evaluations.\n- Return for

CMV screening was negative. Mother denies a history of ear infection after birth or hereditary permanent childhood hearing loss. Patient is diagnosed with achondroplasia prenatally.\n\nMEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Auditory Brainstem Responses were observed at 25 dB at 1k Hz and at 10 to 20 dB from 2k Hz to 8k Hz in right ear and at 30 dB at 1k Hz and at 15 to 20 dB from 2k Hz to 8k Hz in left ear. Unmasked bone was obtained at 20 dB HL. Tympanometry with 1k Hz probe tone reveals normal middle ear function bilaterally. Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions are present from 2k Hz to 8k Hz bilaterally.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Hearing is adequate for speech and language development in right ear and less than optimal in left ear due to a mild loss at 1k Hz.

ABR test results on ********** demonstrate normal hearing sensitivity for the right ear and at least a moderately-severe sensorineural hearing loss for the left ear (unable to rule out crossover from the right ear). MRI completed on ********** suggests a hypoplastic left cochlear nerve. Parents deny a family history of childhood hearing loss. CMV screening was negative. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENTS: \nPatient was tested in natural sleep. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) are present from 2000-8000 Hz for the right ear. DPOAEs are present from 3000-8000 Hz and absent at 2000 Hz for the left ear. \n\nINTERPRETATION: \nABR test results demonstrate normal peripheral hearing sensitivity at 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz for the right ear and a profound sensorineural hearing loss at 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz for the left ear. Hearing is adequate for speech and language development, however, individuals with unilateral hearing loss have increased difficulty understanding speech in noise and localizing sound.

Parents deny birth complications that required any special care in NICU stay.  CMV screening was negative.  Patient's mom reports no family history of childhood hearing loss but his dad was adopted and is unsure of family history.  Patient's dad reportedly has an acquired sensorineural hearing loss that progressed to severe to profound levels at age 37, for which he uses a right cochlear implant and a left hearing aid.  \nHEARING MEASUREMENT:  Patient was tested in natural sleep.  Distortion product oto-acoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were present in each ear at 2-8 KHz.  Tympanometry was obtained with 1000 Hz probe.\nINTERPRETATION:  Results indicate normal hearing sensitivity at 1-8 KHz in the right ear and indicate normal hearing sensitivity at 2-4 KHz rising to mild hearing loss at 1 KHz in the left ear.  The presence of DPOAEs is consistent with normal cochlear outer hair cell function, bilaterally.  Tympanometry is consistent with middle ear mobility in each ear.  \nCONSULTATION:  Results were reviewed with parents.  Patient will be referred to Early Intervention, MEE SLP and MEE educational consultant at the next appointment if hearing loss persists.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:  \n-Return for pediatric otology consultation

She did not spend any time in the NICU. Patient's mother and maternal grandmother both have congenital hearing loss. Mother denies any concerns for ******'s hearing. She reports ****** is meeting all of her milestones so far. CMV screening was not completed. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were tested at .5-10 kHz in both ears. DPOAEs were present at 1.5-10 kHz in the right ear and at 1.5-9 kHz in the left ear. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Results indicate normal hearing sensitivity in both ears from 1-8 kHz.

Initial ABR was limited in results due to a hospital power outage at testing facility. Repeat testing at the Learning Center for the Deaf in Framingham on ********** was consistent with normal hearing sensitivity in the left ear and a severe to profound right hearing loss. CMV screening was negative at birth and there is no known family history of hearing loss. There is a left ear pit. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions are absent in the right ear from 2-8 kHz; unable to complete testing in the left ear due to patient awake state. Tympanometry completed with a 1 kHz probe tone. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Results are consistent with normal hearing sensitivity in the left ear and severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear.

CMV screening was negative.  Parents deny birth complications and family history of childhood hearing loss.\nHEARING MEASUREMENT:  Patient was tested in natural sleep.  Distortion product oto-acoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were present and robust in the left ear at 1-6 KHz and absent in the right ear at 1-6 KHz.  Tympanometry was tested with 1000 Hz probe in the right ear and was not obtained for the left ear due to patient crying and movement.\nINTERPRETATION: Results indicate normal hearing sensitivity in the left ear and at least a severe to profound hearing loss in the right ear, type not determined. It is likely that right ear thresholds are a result of crossover from the left ear as masking was not utilized. Further testing is needed to determine the true level of hearing loss in the right ear.  Hearing is adequate for speech and language development, however, the patient will experience communication difficulties in adverse listening situations, such as the presence of background noise and with sound localization. Tympanometry is consistent with mobility in the right middle ear system.

She referred in both ears on her newborn hearing screening. CMV screening was negative. Father reports a family history of hearing loss on his father's side, as his father's cousins have significant hearing loss. Patient underwent her first natural sleep auditory brainstem response testing on *********, which indicated a profound hearing loss in both ears. MRI done on ********* indicated normal inner ear structures and 7th and 8th cranial nerves, bilaterally. Patient has been referred to Early Intervention. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were measured from 2000-10,000 Hz, bilaterally, with absent responses across all frequencies in both ears. Tympanometry indicated normal ear canal volume (0.41 ml right; 0.57 ml left) with normal mobility (0 daPa right, 25 da daPa left) and compliance (0.3 ml right, 0.4 ml left) bilaterally. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Results are consistent with prior testing indicating a profound sensorineural hearing loss in both ears. Absence of DPOAEs indicates abnormal outer hair cell function as well. This degree of hearing loss is sufficient to interfere with normal speech/language development. The patient is expected to receive limited benefit from amplification based on her degree of hearing loss, however may benefit from cochlear implantation. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: \n- Follow-up with pediatric Otology, as scheduled. \n- Hearing aid consultation/trial. \n- Consider cochlear implantation in either or both ears. \n- Speech language evaluation, as scheduled *********.\n- Genetics

She passed the newborn hearing screening in both ears.  Patient was born at 35 weeks and stayed in the NICU for two months.  Additional medical history include ventricular septal defect (VSD) and laryngomalacia. Patient has feeding difficulties and currently uses a g-tube.

Distortion produced oto-acoustic emissions (DPOAEs) and tympanometry with 1000 Hz probe were attempted but no results were obtained due to patient crying and movement.  Excessive cerumen was noted in the left ear canal and it was difficult to obtain good probe positioning for either ear due to small canal size.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Results indicate normal hearing sensitivity in the right ear at 1-4 KHz and in the left ear at 2-4 KHz and mild hearing loss at 1 KHz in the left ear, type not identified.

The patient did not pass his newborn hearing screening in either ear, two times. Father believes his great uncle had conenital hearing loss. CMV screening at birth was reportedly negative, however this must be confirmed.\n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions are absent bilaterally. Tympanometry using a 1000 Hz probe tone shows mobility in both ears.\n\nINTERPRETATION: No responses were present at the limits of the equipment. This is consistent with profound binaural hearing loss.

Patient's mom denies family history of childhood hearing loss. Patient is following with ID physician, Dr. ****************. Mother denies interim history of ear infections\n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Distortion product oto-acoustic emissions were present in the right ear and absent in left ear at 1 to 6 KHz. Tympanometry was obtained with the use of 1k Hz probe tone.

He passed his newborn hearing screening in his right ear and referred in the left ear. CMV screening was positive. Parents report no other concerns with the patient's health at this time due to his positive CMV finding. \n\nHEARING MEASUREMENT: Patient was tested in natural sleep. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs)were measured from 2000-10,000 Hz in both ears. Emissions were present across all frequencies in both ears. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Results indicate normal hearing sensitivity in both ears from 1000-8000 Hz.
